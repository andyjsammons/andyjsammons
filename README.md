This will be a place for me to upload my projects.

-I have nearly a decade of experience in writing Python code.

-I know some other languages like C/C++ R and Java, though it's
  been some time since I've used those languages.
  
-Some things I'd like to learn: 
  1. Embedded Systems Engineering
  2. assembly programming for various cpu architecture.
  3. some hardware stuff, e.g. hardware debugging tools like multimeter, logic probe, and oscillascope.
  4. Definitely wanna nail down aspects of C programming that professionals use.

- maybe a list of some projects I'd like to start working on
